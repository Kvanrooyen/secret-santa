# Secret Santa

**Disclaimer:** This app is still in development and subject to change. The following is a high-level overview of the planned features.

This is a full-stack Secret Santa application designed specifically for my family. Invitations will be sent via Supabase, ensuring that only our family members can join. Once signed up with an email address, players will log in using a magic link sent to that same email.

After logging in, you’ll see your wishlist and a countdown timer leading up to the gift-giver draw. All data stored in Supabase — including wishlist items and gift pairings — will be encrypted, ensuring that even an admin cannot uncover the secret.
